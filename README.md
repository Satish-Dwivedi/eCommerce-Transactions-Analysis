# Satish Dwivedi's Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis and clustering results for a dataset provided as part of the project. Below is a detailed explanation of the files and their contents.

## Project Structure

### Files Included:

1. *Satish_dwivedi_Clustering.ipynb*  
   This notebook contains the clustering analysis conducted on the dataset. It includes:
   - Data preprocessing steps
   - Application of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.)
   - Visualizations of clustering results

2. *Satish_dwivedi_eda.ipynb*  
   This notebook includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), covering:
   - Descriptive statistics of the data
   - Data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, and box plots)
   - Insights and observations derived from the data

3. *Satish_dwivedi_Lookalike.csv*  
   A CSV file containing the raw dataset used for the analysis.

4. *Reports*
   - *[Clustering Report (HTML)](./Satish_dwivedi_Clustering.html)*: A rendered version of the clustering notebook.
   - *[EDA Report (HTML)](./Satish_dwivedi_EDA.html)*: A rendered version of the EDA notebook.
